      <h2 class="h2-intro">Project Introduction</h2>
      <p class="p-intro">The Chicago Underwater Hockey is a non-profit organization that promotes inclusion and diversity in a healthy and social environment. Underwater hockey is a co-ed sport, with players aged 12 to 82. Because this sport is played in the water, it’s easy on the joints and helps keep people active and healthy. It’s also a great way for people to meet new friends and build relationships. The Chicago UWH team needs to acquire new members and increase members retention to keep this 62-year old club alive. The goal with this website redesign is to bring awareness to the little-known sport and to encourage Chicago residents to give it a try. So, let’s dive in!</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <img class="problem-image" src="images/Problem-image.png">
        <p>Users were disappointed with the limited amount of content on the website. They expected more in-depth information about the sport. They were also frustrated with a number of interface issues that made the webiste confusive and unsuable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h3>The Outcome</h3>
        <img class="outcome-image" src="images/uwh-outcome.png">
        <p>Expanded the website content and redesigned the interface to encourage new members to sign up and provide a one-stop-shop with the resources and information that new and existing members need to accomplish their goals.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><h4>User Persona</h4><p>Developing an user persona allowed us to put ourselves in the users’ position and gain an empathetic understanding of their goals, needs and pain points. The insights from our user persona guided our design process’ actions and efforts. </p></div>

    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><h4>Story Board</h4><p>Understanding the steps the users need to take to perfom their tasks helped us figure out what features are required to meet the users’s needs and how to prioritize our efforts. </p></div>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><h4>Survey</br>
      Key Findings</h4><p>The main objective of the survey was to discover what users expected to find in a sports club website in general. The main expectations were:  About the sport, practice times and locations, upcoming events, pricing, how to join </p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12"><img class="img-col4" src="images/uwh-survey-results.png"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><h4>Interview</br>
      Key Findings</h4><p>We discovered that users were disappointed with the limited information.

    <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h3>Identifying The Problem</h3>
      </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6 ">
   <p>New and prospective club members interested in underwater hockey got discouraged by the website’s lack of relevant information and inefficiency, which forced them to visit multiple online platforms to learn more about the sport and complete the sign-up process. The website presented heuristics and design principle issues like: Cluttered header, small and confusing logo, intrusive and oversized videos, inconsistent and misguided desing and links.</p> 
  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h4>The Website Analysis Results</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><p>The main user interface issues included a cluttered header with inconsistent fonts, a small and not identifiable logo. The homepage video was intrusive, it auto-plays (with sound) and covers most of the screen above the fold, taking up a lot of prime real state and preventing other relevant information to be shown. </p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12"><img class="img-col4" src="images/web-eval1.png"></div>
    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12">
    <p>“Practice Schedule” on the footer is not linked. Inconsistent and misguided links. The footer logo takes you to the Meetup website. "Gallery” headline is misleading, the links are not differentiated with color- unclear that those links take you to YouTube. The Contact Us page has an inconsistent design, the condensed copy is hard to read and does not pass color contrast guidelines. </p></div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-12"><img class="img-col4" src="images/Web-eval-2.png"></div>

    <h3>How We Solved The Problem</h3>
      </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
   <p>Provided one centralized resource hub so new members will have a more pleasant experience and feel more motivated to sign up, more confident and prepared before their first practice, and ready to relax and enjoy the health and social benefits of the sport.</p>

<!--Ideation/Solution -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><h4>Prioritization Matrix</h4><p>The interview data was organized and sorted into a prioritization matrix that allowed us to brainstorm a solution based on what was more important for our user and stakeholders. This information helped us understand where to focus our efforts. </p></div>

    <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-12"><h4>Card Sorting</h4>
    <p>The main objective of the card sorting was to organize the new and expanded website content and define a proper information architecture. We organized, categorized and renamed the primary and secondary pages as well as the footer pages using LATCH. We also incorporated dropdown menus to effectively arrange the content structure </p></div>
